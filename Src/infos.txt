- Web should only use objects and connection to database made only once per version declarate in static and with a public page where an administrator set credentials and initiate the connection, but nobody do that, they using arbitrary static declaration, but objects are like new dynamic variable each time you intentiate it, and static variable is fixed and shared even in an object, so it's possible to create an encrypted page with a password to acces it and send credentials for database connection to a app and a service using a administrator API script. Web devs backend don't know how to use static variables, while they use a file to write visitor number instead you can create a counter with a static variable, while they use class to make clean code instead you can create a json object in a class with ID of clients and their datas declared static, so the datas of the majority of dynamic web sites are mixed between clients, devs don't understand the side effect and the behaviour from all their lines of codes, everything must be rebuilt from zero. Only few devs know that it's possible to see a history of one file on git and to revert changes of commit of this one file, and that formating HTML files like all other type of documents is an optimization, ask them and you will see who is passionate or not, like setting variables to private and constant and function to private, it's also an optimization, because it uses less memory places, but also ask them the effect on optimization for a single line of code, because just getting a length of an array is a big unoptimization, but they will all say it's nothing. A database is expensive and consume a lot, a database is only usefull when an application need to peer data in real time between users, like for social network, or document sharing, or e-mail, or saling/buying products, otherwise it's totally useless to use a database, prefer use SQL lite or localstorage or files, like I did, it's not productive and privacy compilent when no data need to be share, otherwise it's possible to share data localy in a private network or with a file, I also did all of that. 
- Not many people know the difference between let and var for declaring variables in Javascript even if they learned it in school or they can see it with little codes, let is like static for variables. When they iterate through a collection, it's typed badly, but it's so simple, it's like spelling language. They made Youtube video and learn only in school, sometimes, never been in school, it's full of garbage courses on Youtube and with other developpers in any society. Sometimes bad profesors learn only the basic, never explaining the principle like static variables, or clean code or how to use git, even if it's the subject.
